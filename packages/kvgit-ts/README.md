# @agex-ts/kvgit

Versioned key-value store with branches, commits, and three-way merges. A TypeScript port of [agex-py's kvgit](https://github.com/ashenfad/kvgit), redesigned around async storage so it works equally well in Node and the browser.

> **Status:** Pre-alpha. Public API is unstable; pin a specific minor version.

## Concept

A `Map<string, T>` with git-like history. Every `commit()` creates a checkpoint; branches are first-class; sessions can fork cheaply because the underlying HAMT shares structure across versions. Three-way merges are pluggable per key.

## Design

The canonical type contracts live in [`src/types.ts`](./src/types.ts). For how @agex-ts/kvgit is used inside agex-ts, see [agex-ts's State & Sessions concepts doc](../../docs/concepts/state-and-sessions.md).

## Sync & remotes

kvgit histories can be replicated between stores (cross-device session
sync, bundles). The durable design decisions, in case you're extending
this layer:

- **Sync is replication, not storage.** A remote is *not* a `KVStore`
  backend — `KVStore` is the near-storage boundary (HAMT walks assume
  cheap reads), while a remote is a far peer that exchanges history.
  Don't implement a remote by putting a slow store behind `KVStore`;
  implement the wire layer.
- **The unit of transfer is the commit, in wire form** (`WireCommit`
  in [`src/types.ts`](./src/types.ts)): parents, changed value bytes,
  removals, carries, info. Produced by `walkDelta(store, { want, have })`
  ([`src/sync/walk.ts`](./src/sync/walk.ts)) — commits reachable from
  `want` but not `have`, parents-first. `have = ∅` is a full export
  (bundles are the degenerate case).
- **HAMT nodes never cross the wire.** Commit hashes cover parents,
  the keyset pointer map, update bytes, and info — *not* HAMT node
  bytes (see `contentHash` in
  [`src/versioned/layout.ts`](./src/versioned/layout.ts)). Receivers
  rebuild the HAMT locally; root hashes are local pointers and must
  never be compared across stores.
- **Carries are the subtle part.** Merge commits adopt keys from the
  non-first parent *by pointer* (`<owning-commit>:<key>`), without
  rewriting bytes — and the pointer map participates in the commit
  hash. `WireCommit.carries` transports that provenance; a replayer
  that derived pointers from the first parent instead would change
  the hash. Replay must reproduce hashes exactly: recomputing
  `contentHash` over replayed state and comparing is the sync layer's
  integrity check (see the fidelity tests in
  [`tests/sync-walk.test.ts`](./tests/sync-walk.test.ts)).
- **Merge never crosses the wire either.** Remotes move objects and
  CAS refs; reconciliation always happens locally via the existing
  three-way machinery (`commit()` / merge fns). Remotes can therefore
  be *passive* — any object store with compare-and-swap on refs
  qualifies; no kvgit code needs to run on the far side.
- **Parent order is significant.** For three-way merges,
  `parents[0]` is "theirs" (the head that won the CAS race) and
  `parents[1]` is "ours" (`VersionedBase.threeWayMerge`). Wire deltas
  diff against `parents[0]`.
- `__sync_head__<branch>` is reserved for remote-tracking state
  (which remote commit a branch was last synced to).

The storage layout and commit-identity primitives live in
[`src/versioned/layout.ts`](./src/versioned/layout.ts) — the single
source of truth shared by `VersionedKV` and the sync layer. If you
change the layout or hash inputs, both move together and the storage
version sentinel must bump.
