/**
 * HEAD backup, recovery, and repair semantics.
 *
 * Three contracts live here.
 *
 * **prev-HEAD only ever names a commit HEAD really held.**
 * `__branch_head_prev__<branch>` is the input to `resolveHead`'s
 * recovery fallback, so what it names decides what a damaged branch
 * recovers *to*. A value that was never in `__branch_head__<branch>`
 * hands the branch a lineage it never had. Note the guarantee is not
 * "exactly one commit back": the swap and the backup write are two
 * steps, and anything separating them lets an older writer's backup
 * land last (see the limitation pinned at the bottom of this file).
 *
 * **Reading never writes.** Recovery on a read path is in-memory only.
 * Persisting it is either an explicit `repairHead` call or a side
 * effect of a write that has to move HEAD anyway.
 *
 * **`repairHead` reports the store, not its own attempt.** Its answer
 * is the commit HEAD names when it returns, even when another writer
 * moved HEAD underneath it.
 *
 * Every race here is a seam, not a sleep. `HookStore` runs a one-shot
 * callback at a chosen point in a chosen store operation, so "the
 * winner lands between the loser's commit write and its CAS" is
 * expressed exactly and repeats identically. The seams are points
 * every version of the code passes through — a commit's write batch, a
 * read of the HEAD key — never one that exists only in the buggy
 * ordering, so a test written against them means the same thing before
 * and after a fix.
