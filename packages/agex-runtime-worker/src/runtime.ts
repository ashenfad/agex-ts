/**
 * `workerRuntime` — `RuntimeAdapter` that runs each `ts` emission
 * inside a Web Worker.
 *
 * High-level flow per `execute`:
 *
 *   1. Lazily spawn a Worker (on first call, or after a previous
 *      worker was terminated by timeout / abort). Wait for the
 *      worker to post `ready`.
 *   2. Run the configured `transform` on the host side (default
 *      `ts-blank-space`). Surface syntax errors before paying
 *      message-passing cost.
 *   3. `postMessage({ type: 'execute', code, ... })`. Stream
 *      incoming `output` messages into a local buffer. Resolve when
 *      a `result` message arrives.
 *   4. If the per-emission `timeoutMs` fires *or* `ctx.signal`
 *      aborts: `worker.terminate()`, drop the worker, return an
 *      `ExecResult` carrying any outputs collected before the kill
 *      plus a `CancelledError` (for abort) or generic timeout
 *      `Error` (for the budget). The next `execute` spawns a fresh
 *      worker.
 *
 * Cooperative cancellation is a follow-up — today the adapter only
 * does the hard-terminate path, which is enough to honor wall-clock
 * budgets and external aborts.
 *
 * What gets bridged today: `fs` / `cache` (per-execute context),
 * registered fns, registered namespaces, and registered classes.
 * For classes the agent sees a Proxy-backed constructor: `new
 * MyClass(args)` posts `newInstance` to the host (which parks a
 * real instance in the per-execute table), and method calls on the
 * Proxy post `instanceCall` carrying the assigned `instanceId`.
 * Static methods on the class itself dispatch through `target:
 * 'cls'`. Instance state lives entirely host-side; per-emission
 * cleanup releases everything when the execute settles.
